`proc-macro2` acts as either a thin(-ish) wrapper around the std-provided
`proc_macro` crate, or as a fallback implementation of the crate, depending on
where it is used.

If using this crate on older versions of rustc (1.56 and earlier), it will
temporarily replace the panic handler while initializing in order to detect if
it is running within a `proc_macro`, which could lead to surprising behaviour.
This should not be an issue for more recent compiler versions, which support
`proc_macro::is_available()`.

The `proc-macro2` crate's fallback behaviour is not identical to the complex
behaviour of the rustc compiler (e.g. it does not perform unicode normalization
for identifiers), however it behaves well enough for its intended use-case
(tests and scripts processing rust code).

`proc-macro2` does not use unsafe code, however exposes one `unsafe` API to
allow bypassing checks in the fallback implementation when constructing
`Literal` using `from_str_unchecked`. This was intended to only be used by the
`quote!` macro, however it has been removed
(https://github.com/dtolnay/quote/commit/f621fe64a8a501cae8e95ebd6848e637bbc79078),
and is likely completely unused. Even when used, this API shouldn't be able to
cause unsoundness.

This is a fairly straightforward FFI wrapper crate for `regex`, maintained by
the `regex` developers in the same repository.

This crate is explicitly designed for FFI use, and should not be used directly
by Rust code. The exported `extern \"C\"` functions are not marked as `unsafe`,
meaning that it is technically incorrect to use them from within Rust code,
however they are reasonable to use from C code.

The unsafe code in this crate heavily depends on the C caller maintaining
invariants, however these invariants are clearly documented in the `rure.h`
file, bundled with the crate.

I have checked the signatures of each function both in C++ and in the Rust to
ensure they match.  In some places, the c `rure.h` header file is missing a
`const` qualifier which could be present given the Rust code, however this will
have no impact on ABI, and is fairly normal for FFI crates.

Panics are handled in all Rust FFI methods, meaning that projects which do not
disable unwinding will still consistently abort (using `libc::abort()`) if a
panic occurs in the Rust code.
